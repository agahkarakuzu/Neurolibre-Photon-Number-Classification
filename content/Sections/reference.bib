  abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Several measures have been proposed for comparing nonlinear projection methods but so far no comparisons have taken into account one of their most important properties, the trustworthiness of the resulting neighborhood or proximity relationships. One of the main uses of nonlinear mapping methods is to visualize multivariate data, and in such visualizations it is crucial that the visualized proximities can be trusted upon: If two data samples are close to each other on the display they should be close-by in the original space as well. A local measure of trustworthiness is proposed and it is shown for three data sets that neighborhood relationships visualized by the Self-Organizing Map and its variant, the Generative Topographic Mapping, are more trustworthy than visualizations produced by traditional multidimensional scalingbased nonlinear projection methods. 1},

volume={591},
number={7848},
pages={54-60},
abstract={Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms1,2. Present-day photonic quantum computers3--7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {Photonic quantum computing is one of the leading approaches to universal quantum computation. However, large-scale implementation of photonic quantum computing has been hindered by its intrinsic difﬁculties, such as probabilistic entangling gates for photonic qubits and lack of scalable ways to build photonic circuits. Here, we discuss how to overcome these limitations by taking advantage of two key ideas which have recently emerged. One is a hybrid qubit-continuous variable approach for realizing a deterministic universal gate set for photonic qubits. The other is the time-domain multiplexing technique to perform arbitrarily large-scale quantum computing without changing the conﬁguration of photonic circuits. These ideas together will enable scalable implementation of universal photonic quantum computers in which hardware-efﬁcient error correcting codes can be incorporated. Furthermore, all-optical implementation of such systems can increase the operational bandwidth beyond terahertz in principle, ultimately enabling large-scale fault-tolerant universal quantum computers with ultrahigh operation frequency.},

We extend that dynamic range up to 1000 photons, while maintaining sub-shot noise detection process uncertainty of the number of detected photons and beyond that show a monotonic response up to $\approx$ 6 {\textperiodcentered} 106 photons in a single light pulse. This mode of operation, which heats the sensor far beyond its transition edge into the normal conductive regime, offers a technique for connecting single-photon-counting measurements to radiant-power measurements at picowatt levels. Connecting these two usually incompatible operating regimes in a single detector offers significant potential for directly tying photon counting measurements to conventional cryogenic radiometric standards. In addition, our measurements highlight the advantages of a photon-number state source over a coherent pulse source as a tool for characterizing such a detector.},

abstract={Optical-to-electrical conversion, which is the basis of the operation of optical detectors, can be linear or nonlinear. When high sensitivities are needed, single-photon detectors are used, which operate in a strongly nonlinear mode, their response being independent of the number of detected photons. However, photon-number-resolving detectors are needed, particularly in quantum optics, where n-photon states are routinely produced. In quantum communication and quantum information processing, the photon-number-resolving functionality is key to many protocols, such as the implementation of quantum repeaters1 and linear-optics quantum computing2. A linear detector with single-photon sensitivity can also be used for measuring a temporal waveform at extremely low light levels, such as in long-distance optical communications, fluorescence spectroscopy and optical time-domain reflectometry. We demonstrate here a photon-number-resolving detector based on parallel superconducting nanowires and capable of counting up to four photons at telecommunication wavelengths, with an ultralow dark count rate and high counting frequency.},

We employ principal component analysis to maximize the information extracted from output signals, followed by a novel noise-tolerant parameterized approach to the tomography of photon-number resolving detectors. We further propose a measure for rigorously quantifying a detector’s photon-number-resolving capability. Our approach applies to all detectors with continuous-output signals. We illustrate our methods by applying them to experimental data obtained from a transition-edge sensor detector.}

The detector consists of a titanium superconducting transition edge sensor in an optical cavity, which is directly coupled to an optical fiber using an approximately 300-nm gap. The gap reduces the sensitive area and heat capacity of the device, leading to high photon number resolution of 0.42 eV without sacrificing detection efficiency or signal response speed. Wavelength dependent efficiency in fiber-coupled devices, which is due to optical interference between the fiber and the device, is also decreased to less than 1\% in this configuration. The overall system detection efficiency is 98\%{\textpm}1\% at wavelengths of around 850 nm, which is the highest value ever reported in this wavelength range.},

Here we seek improved resolution for a particular superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) through better processing of the TES output waveforms. With that aim, two algorithms to extract number resolution from TES output waveforms are compared. The comparison is done by processing waveform data sets from a TES illuminated at nine illumination levels by a pulsed laser at 1550\&\#xA0;nm. The algorithms are used to sort the individual output waveforms and then create clusters associated with individual photon numbers. The first uses a dot product with the waveform mean (for each illumination level), while the second uses K-means clustering modified to include knowledge of the Poisson distribution. The first algorithm is shown to distinguish adjacent peaks associated with photon numbers up to 19, whereas the second algorithm distinguishes photon numbers up to 23, using the same data.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is widely used in machine learning and big data analytics since it helps to analyze and to visualize large, high-dimensional datasets. In particular, it can considerably help to perform tasks like data clustering and classification. Recently, embedding methods have emerged as a promising direction for improving clustering accuracy. They can preserve the local structure and simultaneously reveal the global structure of data, thereby reasonably improving clustering performance. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance of several clustering algorithms using one of the most successful embedding techniques: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection or {UMAP}. This technique has recently been proposed as a manifold learning technique for dimensionality reduction. It is based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. Our main hypothesis is that {UMAP} would permit to find the best clusterable embedding manifold, and therefore, we applied it as a preprocessing step before performing clustering. We compare the results of many well-known clustering algorithms such ask-means, {HDBSCAN}, {GMM} and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering when they operate on the low-dimension feature space yielded by {UMAP}. A series of experiments on several image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method allows each of the clustering algorithms studied to improve its performance on each dataset considered. Based on Accuracy measure, the improvement can reach a remarkable rate of 60\%.},

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}}

abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.}

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},
